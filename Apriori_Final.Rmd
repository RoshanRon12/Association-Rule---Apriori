# Data Understanding

We work with a dataset on Online Retail. If you want to know more about the dataset, you can check it out [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/online+retail).

Here is the description of the provider of the dataset:

"This is a transnational data set which contains all the transactions occurring between 01/12/2010 and 09/12/2011 for a UK-based and registered non-store online retail.The company mainly sells unique all-occasion gifts. Many customers of the company are wholesalers."

It has the following attributes:

- InvoiceNo: Invoice number. Nominal, a 6-digit integral number uniquely assigned to each transaction. If this code starts with letter 'c', it indicates a cancellation. 
- StockCode: Product (item) code. Nominal, a 5-digit integral number uniquely assigned to each distinct product. 
- Description: Product (item) name. Nominal. 

- Quantity: The quantities of each product (item) per transaction. Numeric.	

- InvoiceDate: Invice Date and time. Numeric, the day and time when each transaction was generated. 

- UnitPrice: Unit price. Numeric, Product price per unit in sterling. 
- CustomerID: Customer number. Nominal, a 5-digit integral number uniquely assigned to each customer. 

- Country: Country name. Nominal, the name of the country where each customer resides.

# Data Preparation

## Raw Data Import

```{r}
# if file does not exist, download it first
file_path <- "./data/OnlineRetail.xlsx"
if (!file.exists(file_path)) { 
  dir.create("./data")
  url <- "https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/00352/Online%20Retail.xlsx"
  download.file(url = url, 
                destfile = file_path, 
                method = "curl")
}

retail <- read_xlsx(path = file_path)
retail %>% head
```

## Filter for missing data

We filter for missing data.

```{r}
retail_mod <- retail %>% 
  na.omit
```

## Data Types

Description is stored as characters

```{r}
retail_mod <- retail_mod %>% 
  mutate(Description = as.factor(Description)) %>% 
  mutate(Hour = unclass(as.POSIXlt(InvoiceDate)$hour))
```

## Exploratory Data Analysis

We check the number of unique products.

```{r}
retail_mod$Description %>% 
  table %>% 
  length
```

The dataset covers a period from `r first(retail_mod$InvoiceDate)` to 
`r last(retail_mod$InvoiceDate)`.

### Count of Items per Purchase

Now we check how many items were purchased.
```{r}
nr_items_per_buy <- retail_mod %>% 
  group_by(InvoiceNo) %>% 
  summarise (items = length(InvoiceNo)) %>%  
  ungroup() %>% 
  group_by(items) %>% 
  summarise(count = length(items))

n_items_max <- 15
g <- nr_items_per_buy %>% 
  dplyr::filter(items <= n_items_max) %>% 
  ggplot(., aes(x = items, y = count))
g <- g + geom_col()
g <- g + scale_x_continuous(breaks = 1:n_items_max)
g <- g + labs (title = "Count and Items", 
               xlab = "Items bought", 
               ylab = "Nr. of Buys")
g <- g + theme_bw()
g
```

The distribution is reasonable and should follow [Benfords law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benford%27s_law).

### Time of Purchase

When are items usually bought?

```{r}
time_of_buy <- retail_mod %>% 
  group_by(Hour) %>% 
  summarise(count = length(Hour))

g <- ggplot(time_of_buy, aes(Hour, count))
g <- g + geom_col()
g <- g + scale_x_continuous(breaks = 6:20)
g <- g + labs (title = "Time of Purchase", 
               xlab = "Hour", 
               ylab = "Nr. of Items sold")
g <- g + theme_bw()
g
```

We see the store is not 24/7. It opens at 6AM and closes at 9PM.

Most sells are done at lunch time.

### Best-selling Products

```{r}
bestsellers <- retail_mod %>% 
  group_by(Description) %>% 
  summarise(count = length(Description)) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  arrange(desc(count)) %>% 
  top_n(10)

g <- bestsellers %>% 
  ggplot(., aes(x = reorder(Description, count),
                y = count))
g <- g + geom_col()
#g <- g + scale_x_continuous(breaks = 6:20)
g <- g + labs (title = "Time of Purchase", 
               xlab = "Hour", 
               ylab = "Nr. of Items sold")
g <- g + theme_bw()
g <- g + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1))
g
```

## Data Reshaping

We need to prepare the data and bring it into a form that transactions can be handled by the algorithm.

```{r}
item_sets <- retail_mod %>% 
  mutate(Description = as.character(Description)) %>% 
  group_by(InvoiceNo) %>% 
  select(Description) %>% 
  summarise_all(funs(paste(Description, collapse = ",")))
```

```{r}
write.csv(x = item_sets$Description, 
          file = "./data/apriori_list.csv", 
          quote = F, 
          row.names = F, 
          col.names = F)
```


## Transformation to Transactions

Now we create a transactions-object based on this dataframe.

```{r}
# m <- as.matrix(item_sets$Description)
# l <- lapply(1:nrow(m), FUN = function(i) (m[i, ]))
# transactions <- as(l, "transactions")
# transactions

transactions <- read.transactions(file = "./data/apriori_list.csv", 
                                  format = "basket", 
                                  sep = ",")
```


# Model 

## Item Frequency

```{r}
transactions %>% 
  head() %>% 
  inspect()
```

```{r}
summary(transactions)
itemFrequencyPlot(transactions, topN = 10, type = "absolute")

```


The graph shows top 10 purchased items.

```{r}
par(mar=c(1,1,1,1))
itemFrequencyPlot(x = transactions, 
                  topN = 10, 
                  type = "absolute")
```

## Cross Table

The cross table shows joint occurences of items.

```{r}
table = crossTable(transactions)
# colnames(table)
selection <- which(colnames(table) %in% c("PARTY BUNTING", "REGENCY CAKESTAND 3 TIER", "WHITE HANGING HEART T-LIGHT HOLDER"))
table[selection, selection] %>% as.data.frame()
```


## Generate Rules

Calculate all rules 

```{r}
transactions_rules <- apriori(transactions, 
                              parameter = list(support = 0.001, confidence = 0.9))
```

Get the top rules, sorted by confidence.

```{r}
transactions_rules %>% 
  sort(by = "confidence") %>% 
  head(5) %>% 
  inspect()
```

Get the top rules, sorted by lift.

```{r}
transactions_rules %>% 
  sort(by = "lift") %>% 
  head(5) %>% 
  inspect()
```

## Visualise Best Rules

```{r}
plot(transactions_rules[1:200])
```


## Specific Rules for an Item

```{r}
tlightholder_rules <- apriori(transactions, 
                      parameter = list(support = 0.01, confidence = 0.01),
                      appearance = list(rhs = "WHITE HANGING HEART T-LIGHT HOLDER"))

tlightholder_rules %>% 
  sort(by = "lift") %>% 
  head(10) %>% 
  inspect()
```

```{r}
plot(tlightholder_rules,
     method="graph", 
     measure="lift", 
     shading="confidence")
```
